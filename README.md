The inspiration for this project came from a Kailh switch tester I purchased to check out various switches.
Since I don't like to let things go to waste, I decided to make this macropad.
First prototype is hand wired, and assembled using the original Pi Pico (non wireless)

Second prototype will sport a proper plate, PCB and bottom plate, and PCB mounted Pi Pico.
